# Target
In this repo, I'll cover some of the steps I took to set up a Spark cluster with up to 20 nodes using Docker. One key point to note is that the cluster uses containers created on WSL for Windows as well as containers set up on a Linux machine. This documentation covers everything from installing the required software to making network adjustments and includes tests and reports along the way.
